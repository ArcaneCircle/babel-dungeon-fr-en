# Babel Dungeon (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·/ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§)

A gamified tool for French/English vocabulary learning

## Creating new flavor

- update `public/manifest.toml` and `public/icon.png`
- replace `test-data.tsv` with the new game data
- update `LANG1_CODE` and `LANG2_CODE` in `src/lib/constants.ts`
- if necessary add localization for the interface strings at
  `src/lib/langs` and update `src/lib/i18n.ts` accordingly.
- update `README.md`
